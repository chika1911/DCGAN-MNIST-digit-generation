# DCGAN-MNIST-digit-generation

This project focuses on training a Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) for MNIST digit recognition. The DCGAN architecture is a combination of a generator network and a discriminator network, which are trained simultaneously in an adversarial manner to generate realistic digit images. The MNIST dataset consists of 60,000 training images of handwritten digits (0-9) and 10,000 test images. In this project, the DCGAN is trained on 20,000 training images only..
